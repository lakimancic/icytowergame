This game is my remake of Free Lunch Design game, Icy Tower.
I didn't do any pixel art, but whole JavaScript code is mine.
It's not exactly same as original game, but I tried to do my best.

Original Icy Tower was designed by Johan Peitz who also wrote the code for
the game. The delicious pixel graphics were made by Emanuel Garnheim.
